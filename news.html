                    <p class="card-text">The British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) Game Awards were held this week. Spoiler alert: What Remains of Edith Finch won Best Game. But to celebrate the nominees, both Steam and the Humble Store have dropped prices on some of the best games of 2017. Many of the deals are the same at both stores, so if you prefer one over the other, be sure to compare prices on the games you want. It's also worth noting that Humble Monthly subscribers get 10% off at the Humble Store. With that out of the way, here's what's on sale.</p>

Origins actually arrives rather late in the story of a great nation that dates back past 3000 BC, but of course, audiences want the great Pyramids, they want the complications of empire, and they want the great Egypt is summoned to mind with names like Cleopatra.</p>
